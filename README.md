## Technologies Used

In the development of GameGo, we've utilized a stack of modern technologies to ensure a responsive, efficient, and secure user experience:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing us to create a dynamic and responsive front-end.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs, used to fetch data efficiently and manage the data flow between server and client.
- **Apollo**: An implementation of GraphQL that simplifies data management in React applications by handling data fetching, caching, and state management.
- **Slick Carousel**: A responsive carousel component for React, used to create the featured products slider on the homepage.
- **Mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js that manages relationships between data and provides schema validation.
- **Bcrypt**: A library to help hash passwords, ensuring that user password data is encrypted and secure.
- **Express**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, used to build the backend API.
- **Nodemon**: A utility that monitors for any changes in your source and automatically restarts your server, improving the development process.

Each of these technologies has been chosen to provide a seamless and scalable e-commerce experience, from product browsing to checkout.

## Features

- **Featured Products Carousel**: Highlights the latest and most popular gaming selections.
- **Product Categories**: Easy navigation through game categories for Genesis, Gameboy, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.
- **Product Listings**: Detailed listings including the game title, price, stock availability, and an option to add to cart.
- **Responsive Design**: A user-friendly interface that adjusts to different screen sizes for optimal browsing.
- **User Account Management**: Users can create an account to view order history and manage their shopping cart.
